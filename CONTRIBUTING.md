## Contributing

Everyone who has ideas and suggestions for improvement is encouraged to contribute. Be it with a simple issue or a pull request. Our goal is to create the best template for contribution guidelines, which helps every open source developer to create an individual guide. It should be made clear to project owners how comprehensible and simple guidelines are structured and how to encourage the community to participate in the project. And don't hesitate, even if it is just a small typo you have spotted.


1. Clone the repo
2. Take up an existing issue or create an issue and then raise a pull request
3. Before raising the PR make sure you have formatted with black and used pylint to test code quality.
4. In the PR:


```
Describe the problem. 
Checklist
- [ ] Pylint score should be > 8
- [ ] Use black as formatter
- [ ] Attach screenshots when solved
```

Happy contributing!
